// Note: Write a solution with O(n2) time complexity, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

// You have an array a composed of exactly n elements. Given a number x, determine whether or not a contains three elements for which the sum is exactly x.

// Example

// For x = 15 and a = [14, 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 3], the output should be
// tripletSum(x, a) = false;

// For x = 8 and a = [1, 1, 2, 5, 3], the output should be
// tripletSum(x, a) = true.

// The given array contains the elements 1,2, and 5, which add up to 8.
var x = 15, a = [14, 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 3];
var y = 8, b = [1, 1, 2, 5, 3];

function tripletSum(x, a) {

}

console.log(tripletSum(x, a))
console.log(tripletSum(y, b))
