// Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

// Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

// Example

// For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
// circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.

function circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) {
  // Set the difference equal to n divided by 2
  // If the first number is larger than n, subtract the difference
  // Else add the difference
